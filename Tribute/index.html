                <h2>About Shaheed Bhagat Singh</h2>
                <p>
                    Shaheed Bhagat Singh was one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. Born on September 28, 1907, in the Lyallpur district of Punjab, he was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the subsequent violence. 
                    Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican Association, later known as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, where he became a prominent figure. His commitment to independence led to his participation in various revolutionary activities, including the famous Central Legislative Assembly bombing in 1929, where he and Batukeshwar Dutt threw non-lethal bombs to protest against repressive laws.
